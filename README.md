In the context of my Engineers Degree (in progress as of 2016) and in the context of the course Industrial Informatic Systems
(Sistemas Informaticos Industriales, SII), this is a simple, kind of naive, model of the QNX Real Time Operating System
Synchronous IPC Messaging.


This project requires Rust and Cargo.
